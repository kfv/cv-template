# cv-template

Welcome to my cv-template repository. Herein you can find my
personal CV [template.cls](template.cls) document class file,
along with an example file that outlines a basic structure
and usage guidelines.

This document class is originally written for
[my personal CV](https://kfv.io/about/cv.pdf).
As such, it may not possess the degree of perfection and
flexibility that a broader public template shall meet.
You might need to tweak certain aspects such as paper margins,
environments, or exposed commands to fit your specific needs.
